# day-planner
## 👨‍💻 Mission
Design a tool to increase productivity in users by helping them plan for their day.

## 🌐 Application
<a href="https://pr1me-e1gh7.github.io/day-planner/">Link to the App</a>

## 💻 User Experience
```md
When user's load the page they'll see the welcome banner displaying the current time and date and a motivational quote, as well as the remaining portion of the page where they will be able to interact with the planner. The planner portion of the page is a list of hour blocks from 8 AM to 8 PM, with a text box and save button to keep tasks the user has entered in the text box saved to the local storage. Should the user refresh the page after they've saved their tasks, the tasks will remain in their text boxes. The background color of each text box will change depending on the time, where red will represent an hour that has past for the day, purple will represent the current hour, and blue will represent upcoming hours. At the bottom of the page is a button to clear all tasks should the user choose to start from scratch.
```
